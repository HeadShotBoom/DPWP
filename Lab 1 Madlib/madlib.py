# Dear PROFESSORS NAME
# I am currently in your CLASS NAME class for the AGE time and I am wondering if I could get an extension on my homework about PLURAL NOUN.
# I wont be able to attend class for the next SECONDS I CAN HOLD BREATH week due to a MODE OF TRANSPORTATION accident.
# I also broke my BODY PART while ACTIVITIES FOR GRANDPARENTS so I am unable to operate the complexities of FSO 3.0.
# I feel EMOTION that you are giving me this exception, and if necessary ill give you $HOW MANY FINGERS to give me a 100 on this assignment.
# Sincerely,
# NICKNAME
