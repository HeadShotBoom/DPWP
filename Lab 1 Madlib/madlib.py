Dear PROFESSORS NAME
I am currently in your CLASS NAME class for the AGE time and I am wondering if I could get an extension on my homework about PLURAL NOUN.
I wonâ€™t be able to attend class for the next SECONDS I CAN HOLD BREATH week due to a MODE OF TRANSPORTATION accident. I also broke my BODY PART
while ACTIVITIES FOR GRANDPARENTS so I am unable to operate the complexities of FSO 3.0.
I feel EMOTION that you are giving me this exception, and if necessary ill give you $HOW MANY FINGERS to give me a 100 on this assignment.
Sincerely,
NICKNAME'''
